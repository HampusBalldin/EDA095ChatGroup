Using <a common server relay>, two different users may <using a browser of their choice> connect to each other in order to 
(for example) send chat messages. Note however that the technology could be used for any <Browser Push> solution.
The server may of course handle multiple simultaneous connections using multiple threads.
The server is implemented in Java. The client side is written in JavaScript.

                                 _____________
Client_A Send------------------>|             |------------------> Client_B Receive
                                |   Server    |
                                |   Relay     |
Client_A Receive  <-------------|_____________| <----------------- Client_B Send  

Note worthy web technologies and solutions in the project:
  a) Push technologies through sustained HTTP Connections and delayed (asynchronous) responses.
  b) Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) to
   i) marshal: Java Object -> XML
   ii) unmarshal: XML -> Java Object
  c) XJC used to <generate> java classes from xml schema used in a) to marshal / unmarshal.
  d) A (self-made) database abstraction which makes handling database insertions, queries, 
      and updates transparent to the programmer.
