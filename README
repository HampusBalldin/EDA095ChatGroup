Using <a common server relay>, two different users may <using a browser of their choice> connect to each other.
The server may of course handle multiple simultaneous connections using multiple threads.
The server is implemented in Java. The client side is written in JavaScript.

Note worthy web technologies and solutions in the project:
  a) Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) to
   i) marshal: Java Object -> XML
   ii) unmarshal: XML -> Java Object
  b) XJC used to <generate> java classes from xml schema used in a) to marshal / unmarshal.
  b) A (self-made) database abstraction which makes handling database insertions, queries, and updates transparent to the programmer.
  c)
